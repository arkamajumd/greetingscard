# Greetings Card
Customizable greetings card for celebrating any occasion. Originally made it using lots of Java2D graphics to celebrate my baby cousin's birthday when I was 13.

## Customization
You can personalize the card for your own needs by editing the static variables in [`src/me/birthdaycard/Birthday.java`](https://github.com/arkamajumd/greetingscard/blob/master/src/me/birthdaycard/Birthday.java):

 * _`dear`_ is the string that appears in the top left corner with a "handwritten" animation.
 * _`giant`_ is the giant text that is outlined and scrolls into view on top of the hill.
 * _`title`_ is the title of the main `JFrame`.
